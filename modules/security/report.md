You work as a design engineer at Northumbria Internetworking Inc. The company has recently received a request for a proposal from an International supermarket chain regarding a potential business opportunity in the greater Newcastle area. Your task is to propose a secure network design that meets customerâ€™s requirements. \par

Project Report: The project report should provide your design and recommendations for the planned network. Please pay attention to the following points in designing your security solution and preparation of report; \par

# Threat Model

Identification of threats with clear and evident threat trees relevant and linked to the case.
Appropriate attack libraries and literature review throughout the section with clear links to defensive tactics, mitigation strategies and validation of threats.
A systematic approach has been taken to fully utilize most relevant and appropriate technologies and threat modelling tools with rationalization on the challenges and issues in this scenario.
Links to the way that cloud threats have been identified and linked to the case with clear indicators and discussion on taxonomies. \par

Identify the threats, attacks arising from the proposed description of the planned network. Are there any aspects of the proposed network that pose a significant threat to sensitive data? \par

## Threats

Identification: \par

# Design Specification

Design specifications with solid evidence on selection of technologies, controls. Clear and impact full motivation and clear rationale on the selections but most importantly exclusions made threat and vulnerabilities identification using structured and well-defined methodologies and tools. Students managed to demonstrate a scalable network architecture with clear controls in place and full rationalisation on scalability, privacy, security and autonomy. Ability to demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of solutions in place or those excluded from the design. \par

Since the network would carry sensitive financial information, security and privacy is the top priority. You must provide a clear rationale and motivation for the technology/technologies you would select for the proposed network. Discuss in details which security vulnerabilities are addressed by your proposed solution. \par

# Ethical, Legal and Social Impacts

Remarks and definitions on the common legal and ethical aspects in the domain of interest with discussion on considerations that can influence the outcome of both the design and selection of controls in place. Students give the professional code of practice and privacy requirement with clear and a holistic discussion of the area with links to the case study with clear list of ethical issues and legal considerations. \par

You must also perform a review of ethical, legal and social issues that may arise from the planned network and how your proposed design/recommendations would address them. \par

# Conclusion

Conclusions with clear remarks on the strengths and limitations of the work undertaken with clear and strong evidence on the suggestions, recommendation and way forward with strong research underpinned solutions students managed to produce a summary of the work with clear indicators on their limitations, exclusions and way forward in this domain. \par

Design recommendations, summary of ethical, legal, social impacts. \par
