## Writing a Research Proposal

A proposal is a special type of scientific article, as it describes what shall be done in the future.

For sure you will have to write a proposal for your master's thesis (now or later). Furthermore, both in academic research and in industrial practice, proposals are required if one wants to apply for funding for a project. The specific guidelines are, of course, very different, but all research proposals must more or less contain the following items, in an appropriate order:

* Summarize the background and the state-of-the-art, witnessed by some key references.
* Specify at least one clearly defined research question.
* Motivate why the planned project is important at all. (For funding applications one can put it this way: Why should the financer give money for it?)
* Argue why this is a significant step (and not only some routine work) and will increase the knowledge or the repository of methods in this field of work. Specify the scientific challenges.
* Describe as clearly as possible what shall be done and accomplished. In particular: What problems exist, what are current solution mehtods, what are their limitations or drawbacks, etc.?
* As far as possible, describe the approach(es) to be taken. In this way convince the reviewer that you have a clear idea of your project, and that is is manageable and realistic.
* Also give delimitations: What is out of scope and will not be considered in this work?

A proposal should be understandable also for reviewers (who decide on the acceptance!) that are not exactly experts in the specific domain.

An obvious objection is that the result of research cannot be predicted (otherwise it would not be research). But the understanding is that a proposal reflects the current knowledge, plans, and expectations. During the actual work, the initial plan can always be adjusted due to unexpected findings. This does not speak against having a plan.
