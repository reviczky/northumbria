# Introduction

The world is getting more and more connected and whilst the newest technologies of auto-piloted cars, autonomous drones and remote controlled planes are shaping the way of modern cyber-physical systems, the increased cyber security threats are playing a bigger role than ever \cite[loukas2015cyber]. \par

\blank[line]

This proposal for a master's dissertation on the "Internet of Things" is looking at a novel way of predicting cyber threats of a specific sub-set of said cyber-physical systems \cite[citeulike:13779694], by applying a specialised version of the Bayesian estimation to compare the predicted behaviour of cyber-physical systems with the actual motion patterns \cite[Fox03bayesianfiltering]. Taking advantage of known-good behaviour of large-scale movement flows at a regulated traffic, it can be deducted when a system behaves in a rogue manner. \par

# Aim

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the pro-active approach of predicting cyber security threats in connected cars, as an example of a cyber-physical system, through deviations in behaviour profiling patterns on location awareness using mathematical probability density functions. \par

\blank[line]

By detecting deviations from predicted desired future state spectrum the project will achieve to create a warning mechanism for cyber threats on cyber-physical systems and being able to react in a fail-safe manner. \par

# Objectives

In order to show, 
The following steps are needed in order to achive the aims: \par

* connected cars as a case study of cyber-physical systems
* behaviour profiling on past location data (sensors)
* applying density functions, bayesian estimation algorithms
* validation of prediction (simulations)
* live warning alarm (*pull up*)
* steps for fail-safe disconnection

With those steps \par

# Background

graphs!

motivation
even though the theory can be applied for any CPS and not just on movenet but any behaviour, this is focusing on cars and location

# Ethical Issues

Several aspects of ethics will come up with any autonomous or cyber-physical system, as naturally, the implications of systems in our life will raise fundamental questions around behaviour, trust and safety.
Apart from the most pressing question around legal accountability, the following points are to be considered: \par

* In the case of vehicles (but also for planes or drones), what are the impacts of collision decisions (impact of fatal casualties and prioritisation)
* Personally identifiable information (PII) patterns on behaviour is a very sensitive topic and needs to be addressed accordingly (apart from the legal frameworks)
* Having a huge set of data captured and stored, who will have access to this (manufacturers, governments, third parties?)
* Anonymisation expectations from the society versus the accountability of insurers (this will lead also to legal implications)
* Implementation of a "Right-to-forget" clause on the legal side to accustomise social expectations on data storage and analysis

## Professional Issues

Most of the professional issues will be around accountability of the autonomous or semi-autonomous systems.
Although these will be also driven by local laws and regulations, ultimately it has to be made clear whether the manufacturer, the owner or some custodian of the system will be held accountable for the behaviour and actions of the system. \par

## Legal Issues

On the legal implications, because of the global scope of vehicles (or in fact any autonomous transportation system), the local laws and legislations will have to be adapted to.
Moreover, the big issues around Data Privacy, Data Protection will dominate how a data-collection driven solution will work out \cite[millard2013cloud]. Anonymisation is one way to support the required analysis, but the question around personal information (name, age, gender and characteristics), attributed information (speeding or typical behaviour) and identifiable information (geo-location, car type, face recognition) needs to be addressed. \par

## Social Issues

In terms of social issues, the wider question that needs to be discussed is whether and how society can trust autonomous machines.
With a direct correlation into real-life events, the topics of accountability (children in cars for example) and dealing with economics (job losses through automation) are not exclusively legal issues. \par

# Resources / Constraints

## Resources outside Northumbria

The main resource for this study is based on connected transportation systems like cars, drones or planes.
Currently only a few manufacturers have production ready connected cars, the likes of Tesla, Daimler, BMW and Volvo. \par

\blank[line]

Without having access to these resources at Northumbria nor on personal resources during the case study, data will be generated and the analysis based on those inferred data-sets. \par

## External Limitations

To conduct the tests and validations of the human behavioural patterns there would be a reliance on either test persons driving connected cars or from car manufacturers to provide real data.
Due to legal constraints and the lack of people owning connected cars that would participate in this study, the scope is changed to use inferred data instead of real life data. \par

\blank[line]

Communication with the supervisor is done through email messages and in-person meet-ups at the London campus. \par

## Distance Learning

The presentation of the viva is expected to be conducted at the London campus of Northumbria University. This is preliminarily scheduled for February 2017. \par
