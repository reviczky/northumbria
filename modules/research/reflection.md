# Personal Reflection

This is a summary of my individual critical reflection \cite[brookfield1991developing] for the group work assessment for module 5, Research and Project Management as an exercise in project management skills and the experience I had being part of "Group 5". \par

## Group Selection

The group was selected on mutual approach by the members during the lecture classes and based on the positive outcome of the last group work and the like-minded nature of the peers.
This selection seemed to be more successful than a random assignment of group members. \par

## Group Work

After equally dividing the group work amongst the group members and creating a plan for the collaboration and draft submissions \cite[mezirow1990fostering], the work was carried out by each member in a professional manner and each of the members were supporting each other with the work, helping out with difficult sections.
Also, there was an opportunity to relate back to personal experiences with previous project management roles from work experience.
The meetings helped to practice the hands-on experience on the different tools and methodologies of project management, which on the other hand, helped the even distribution of the workload. Thus, the collaboration experience and interaction within the group was very good. \par

## Assignment Critique

Reflecting on the assignment, the deadline was very challenging, but the spirit of the group was great and everyone was focused on delivering on a high quality.
Even though the assignment itself was very clear and transparent, in my opinion, the tight deadline should be looked at for future assignments. \par

## Evaluation

Overall, the group work was a huge success and the project management skills were advanced by the practical work carried out during research and collaborative work \cite[schon1987educating].
Skills in handling group work was strengthened and the assignment helped me to reflect on various topics for the dissertation, hence benefiting from the course.
Thus, I conclude, it was a pleasure to work with Rafael and Stefan on this assignment. There was a unanimous agreement on the positive experience and outcome of the work and we would be happy to work again on the next occasion. \par
