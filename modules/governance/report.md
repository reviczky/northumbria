The scope of this \infull{ISMS} (\ISMS\) has been set as the "Lending Warehousing System" of a global tier one financial services organisation. A lending warehousing system is a system for granting lines of credit in order to fund a mortgage and it is identified as a crucial part of the business. The data being processed within this system is classified as sensitive information that needs to be protected and dealt with accordingly.
It is utmost important for financial institutes to have the right information governance in place as their main business is dealing with high-risk transactions to maximise profits for the stakeholders, as any mistake being intentional or accidental could lead not just to threaten the entire business as such, but also, the wider economy within the country or even globally as historical events showed. \par

Further to the data classification, which holds information that is deemed as \infull{CID} (\CID\), the nature of the business is multicultural, being represented around the globe with clients from \infull{APAC} (\APAC\), \infull{EMEA} (\EMEA\) or the \infull{AMER} (\AMER\), each with their own legislations, laws and culture of business. There are specific laws when data is in transit or being exchanges (U.S.-EU & U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks). Some countries like Switzerland or Germany (Workers Council, Union) impose strict restrictions on where data can be stored and how it can be accessed and by whom, that results in an additional challenge for each decision that has to be made.
After the financial crisis, regulations for financial services has tightened and many regulatory bodies (like MAS and SOX, RBI, NYFBR, FINMA, BAFIN, FCA, BoE) oversee the business with wide-ranging implications. Not conforming to these regulatory requirement will lead to a revocation of business in the respective countries. \par

As with most multi-national companies, the competition has to be looked at. In the banking industry another major aspect from the clients point of view is the institutions reputation. The loss in trust will result in a huge financial loss to the business, that is difficult to restore. \par

\blank[line]

But not just the laws, regulations and sensitivity regarding the information that is held by the bank are the only factors that affects the processes and policies how to protected the data, external threats as in cyber attacks are increasing and posing more and more a risk that is on the top priority for every major organisation.
With the modern way of storing as much data as possible and using big data to process these mountains of information another hurdle arises when specific data is requested as part of an investigation, litigation case or fraudulent activities of internal employees. Logistically it could end up being more costly to locate the right data from the archive, that the law requires to maintain, then settling out of court. \par

\blank[line]

It is now clear that governance around information is not just required but the difference is how well the processes are defined, how good the data is protected in order to enable the business to operate and take all aspects laid out above into account. \par

\blank[line]

Developing an appropriate information governance requires to look at the current situation within the company in order to see the current situation and propose improvements. Historically these institutions are doing business for a long time over decades of years and the reluctancy for changes resulted being way behind the curve for adapting new and modern methodologies. For a long time there was no information governance framework in place at all, and slowly with the growing need the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) framework was chosen and introduced as a first step for information governance.
As every business is different and every board has a different direction and appetite for doing business, there needs to be more than just choosing an appropriate framework and adjusting it to the business' needs. \par

1. Critically articulate the role of information governance and security frameworks within the context of information systems management across a range of organisations with different drivers and goals.
2. Critically appraise the relationships between the key information security, information management and governance standards and other forms of best practice, and their relationship to legal requirements.
3. Make judgements about ethical considerations relating to  information governance, management and security at an  organisational, professional and societal level.
4. Critically evaluate people, processes and systems in order to  develop information and records management policies and procedures in respect of information governance and security.
5. Propose recommendations on approaches to information risk  management that are appropriate for a given context based on a detailed knowledge of risk management concepts in respect of  information governance, management and security.
