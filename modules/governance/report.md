The scope of this \infull{ISMS} (\ISMS\) has been set as the "Lending Warehousing System" of a global tier one financial services organisation. A lending warehousing system is a system for granting lines of credit in order to fund a mortgage and it is identified as a crucial part of the business. The data being processed within this system is classified as sensitive information that needs to be protected and dealt with accordingly.
It is utmost important for financial institutes to have the right information governance in place as their main business is dealing with high-risk transactions to maximise profits for the stakeholders, as any mistake being maliciously intentional or accidental could lead not just to threaten the entire business as such, but also, the wider economy within the country or even globally as historical events showed. \par

Further to the data classification, which holds information that is deemed as \infull{CID} (\CID\), the nature of the business is multicultural, being represented around the globe with clients from \infull{APAC} (\APAC\), \infull{EMEA} (\EMEA\) or the \infull{AMER} (\AMER\), each with their own legislations, laws, culture and customs of business. Ethics and reputation has to considered when considering whether doing business in certain countried or not, for example women doing business or countries at war.
Specific laws have to be obeyed when data is in transit or being exchanged (U.S.-EU & U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks). Some countries like Switzerland or Germany (Works Council, Trade Unions) impose strict restrictions on where data can be stored and how it can be accessed and by whom, that results in an additional challenge for each decision that has to be made.
After the financial crisis, regulations for financial services has tightened and many regulatory bodies (\infull{MAS}, \infull{SOX}, \infull{RBI}, \infull{FRBNY}, \infull{FINMA}, \infull{BAFIN}, \infull{FCA} and \infull{BoE})\cite[mallin2013corporate] oversee the business with wide-ranging implications. Not conforming to these regulatory requirement will lead to a revocation of business in the respective countries. One of the biggest regulatory framework that all financial institutes have to comply with is Basel III. \par

\blank[line]

As with most multi-national companies, the competition within the market has to be looked at together with industry best practices. In the banking industry another major aspect from the clients point of view is the institutions reputation. The loss in trust will result in a huge financial loss to the business, that is difficult to restore. \par

\blank[line]

But not just the laws, regulations and sensitivity regarding the information that is held by the bank are the only factors that affects the processes and policies of how to protected the data. External threats as in cyber attacks are increasing and posing more and more a risk that is on the top priority for every major organisation.
With the modern way of storing as much data as possible and using big data to process these mountains of information another hurdle arises when specific data is requested as part of an investigation, litigation case or fraudulent activities of internal employees. Logistically it could end up being more costly to locate the right data from the archive, that the law requires to maintain, then settling out of court. \par

\blank[line]

It is now clear that governance around information is not just required but the difference is how well the processes are defined, how good the data is protected in order to enable the business to operate by taking all aspects laid out above into account. \par

\blank[line]

To develop an appropriate information governance tailored to the organisational needs it is required to look at the current landscape of governance within the company in order to see the gaps and waht improvements has to be done. Historically these institutions are doing business for a long time over decades of years and the reluctancy for changes resulted being way behind the curve for adapting new and modern methodologies and frameworks. For a long time there was no information governance framework per se in place, nonetheless, with the growing need of information assurance the trend is going towards the implemention of the \infull{COBIT} (\COBIT\) framework. Therefore, that will be taken as the current baseline for information governance. \par

\blank[line]

As a first step, it is inevitable to look at the Records Management around the records and assets that the company is holding \cite[alexander2013information], the process around the life-cycle of each record. As with most financial institutes, the majority of records are digital by now and the business critical assets are client data and algorithms. The ISO 27001 standard has been used for making an inventory list.
Before a classification of each asset can be made and the resulting process around its life-cycle, there is a dependency on the organisations risk appetite, which will determine these metrics. As with most major investment banks, there is a tendency to have a greater risk appetite towards financial risk, even though that is now contained strongly with the regulations mentioned above.
As an example the \infull{ISF} \(ISF\) shows a risk appetite matrix how to define the high level risk appetite, see table \in[table:iram2]. \par

\blank[line]

Every business is different, its board a different direction for doing business and this organisations appetite has been defined as taking higher stakes on Financial and Legal risk but less on Reputational, Operational and Health and Safety risks.
The more risk is accepted the greater the profits can be and on the counterside the losses as well. \par

Generally, in order to look at the different approaches for data classification, risk assessment, risk evaluation and risk impact and the output of a risk treatment plan in order to assure information assurance, it has to be looked at what methotologies, frameworks and industry standards are available alongside with the organisations current implementation.
For that, the research focused on the \infull{NIST} and \infull{ISF} with elements of the currently implemented \infull{COBIT} framework. From this a specific methodology was developed, modifying and adjusting the found tools and techniques to suit and align to the enterprise's needs. \par

\blank[line]

The following information governance approach is proposed: \par

\blank[line]

Classification of assets are divided into confidenciality and integrity classes and each asset has to be classified with those scales.
Knowing the assets and the risk appetite together with the classification of each asset a Risk Assessment or Risk Opinion will conclude with attached risks and highlight the implications of those risks. For this financial services organisation it is also crucial to introduce business continuity scales that can prioritise assets based on business criticality. \par

\blank[line]

The formal risk assessment follows the evaluation of impact risk based on financial, operational, regulatory and reputational risks. It has been agreed with senior management to have levels from 1 to 5 for each risk category and monetary ranges for the financial risk depending on the current market value of the organisation.
To conclude with a final risk rating a likelihood scale, which is most often left out in implementations of risk frameworks in current organsations, from Low to High has been defined based on historical data of occurence. \par

\blank[line]

The level of risk can now be shown in a matrix as seen in table \in[table:orf] which mirrors the risk appetite for this enterprise. \par

\blank[line]

Now that the attached risks have been identified the next step is to develop a risk treatment plan for the business in order to determine the cost/benefit analysis for how to tackle these risks. \infull{GRC} is involved in the proposal for risk treatment and this company will only address risk issues that were rated as high or very high, given the agreed risk appetite. \par

\blank[line]

There are four ways to treat a risk, each can be either mitigated by actions, transferred to other parties, accepted as they are or avoided by specific actions. \par

\blank[line]

All of the high and very high risks will be looked at to mitigate and through that downgrade to moderate or lower risk levels. As the final risk rating already takes the financial aspects into account, the question of the implementation of the risk treatment plan and the options for mitigating actions will be decided by senior management rather than the risk team.
Success criteria and action plans are imoportant to define in order to close the risk findings. \par

The process for risk treatments is tracked via a risk index system, and operational risk managers \cite[sherwood2005enterprise] are assigned to each stream within the bank to track the agreed time-scale and to assess the justification over time and the controls in place that will have an effect on the identified risks. Change Management systems are used for the improvement steps that need to be implemented.
The tendency is towards risks that are identified as regulatory findings and there is little room for strategic decisions to close those risks. \par

\blank[line]

The overall aim for improving the information governance and the implementation of the risk treatment plan is to reduce the organisations risk level to an acceptable level in order to operate and minimise potential losses.
The key drivers in this business in a challenging environment are always profit, and those risks that either enable to create huge profits or are at danger to threaten revenue will be looked at most closely. \par
