# Assignment
* The production of an inventory of information assets developed with
- a risk assessment
- a risk evaluation
- a proposed risk treatment plan.
* These outputs should be accompanied by a report justifying the information governance requirements for these assets, explaining the risk approach and making recommendations to progress the work required.

# Demonstration of learning
* This assignment is designed to enable you to demonstrate you have understood the key components and principles that need to be considered when developing an information governance framework and that you can deliver these in practice.
* It should demonstrate that you have included key aspects from each of the chapters within the learning materials that are relevant to the assignment.

# Asset Inventory
* Against the agreed Information Security Management System (ISMS) scope you must develop a complete information asset inventory.
* This should encompass information assets in their broadest form within the context of the ISMS scope
- Software
- Hardware
- People
- Records
- Places

# Risk register & treatment plan
* For each of the identified information assets, you must undertake and document a risk assessment.
* Based on your assessment, you must
- evaluate the risks
- draw up a proposed risk treatment plan.
- You should indicate the impact (positive & negative) of the risk treatment plan if implemented.
+ Financial
+ Operational
+ Legal & Regulatory

* You may chose to develop the risk approach which you feel is most appropriate to deliver information assurance within the context of the ISMS scope and the wider organisational environment against which your assignment is set.
* The documentation provided should clearly set out your risk processes.

# Report
* Accompanying the inventory, risk assessment, risk evaluation and risk treatment plan, there must be a _formal report_ (not more than _2-2,500 words_), with the module tutor as the intended audience
- Explain the context of the importance of information governance within the context of your ISMS scope
- Justify your overall risk approach and resource investment in the risk treatment plan.
- It should make recommendations for delivering the risk treatment plan including the structures for managing the process, progressing the risk treatments proposed, reporting risks, and reviewing the system.
* As this is an academic assignment, the report should include citations where relevant, formatted in accordance with academic standards

# Format
* Your documents will be printed out for marking
- Red pen by marker
- Black pen by moderator
* A4 portrait for text
* Maximum 1 page A3 landscape width for spreadsheets.
- Format for narrow margins
- Use a 10 point font

#Too big !
* Do __not__ produce a spreadsheet like this
- It takes a long time to print and assemble and will not make you popular with the marker !

# Filenames
* Start all filenames with your full name to make them easy to identify.
* Make sure that every document has your name and student number in it, even if only in the header or footer
- Allows easy identification once printed
* __DO NOT__ embed other document inside your documents, submit every one separately.
- Having to go back and print them will not make you popular with the marker

# Required
* You must include at the end of the piece of work
- the number of words in the body of the text excluding appendices
- bibliography list
- reference list
- Contents
- executive summary
- abstract.

# Submission of assignment
* The inventory and risk processes may be developed using any tool which you feel is appropriate
- Word, Excel, a database etc.
- You must be able to create an accessible report format (e.g. PDF, Excel file etc) which contains all of the key details to email with the assignment documents as a whole.
* The assignment should be submitted electronically to the NU eLearning Portal

# Originality
* You must observe copyright law when submitting your assignment
* You must cite all sources and references appropriately.
* _Formal inquiry proceedings will be instigated if there is any suspicion of misconduct or plagiarism in the preparation of answers._
* _Misconduct includes instances of collaboration._

# Comments on a distinction paper
* _Development of an inventory of assets            20%_
* _Completeness_
* There was a very detailed approach in respect of the development of the inventory.
* The inventory included records, systems and personnel and the nature and location of each was clearly identified.
* _Fitness for purpose_
* In the context of the scoped assignment the detail was appropriate given the significance of the minutes within the organizational setting.
* Each asset was clearly labeled, numbered and an information asset owner was assigned.
* The layout in the Excel spreadsheet was really clearly presented
* _Development of a risk framework          50%_
* Development of a risk assessment, risk evaluation, proposed risk treatment plan and impact assessment including extent, accuracy, fitness for purpose and delivery.
* X had thought through all the risks very carefully and really strongly developed the narrative descriptions within the analysis sections.
* They had modified existing risk matrices to ensure that within the organisational context the risk evaluation was fit for purpose.
* The scoring system was complicated but the wide ranging scores did enable priorities to be clearly listed.
* In addition the process for treatment or acceptance was clearly set out.
* In summary this was an excellently thought through and executed presentation of the risks, which could be transferred straight into practice without any alterations.
* _Accompanying report                      30%_
* _justification of the importance of information governance_
* X presented the importance of information governance within the context. The key drivers for, and the current state of information governance within the organisation and wider legislative context were articulated very clearly.
* _critical evaluation of the risk approach and rationale for the risk treatment design based on an understanding of the organisation and reference to best practice_
* The approach to risk was clearly defined and well thought out. It was structured and scoped within an ISO 27000 context and it was developed from a records manager's perspective, which would be an important consideration if it was subsequently reviewed. The Change Management diagram was a helpful inclusion. Further diagrams or supporting appendices could have further aided the deliver of the risk approach.
* _critical analysis and evaluation of the resource requirements and recommendations for the approach in order to implement the risk treatment plan_
* Careful thought had been given to the structures and resources required to implement the risk treatment plan.
* _Presentation including appropriate language/ clarity of expression, style, format and length_
* The report clearly set out its scope, approach and stated aims
* X clearly structured and presented the report. The tables within the body of the report aided the overall clarity of the presentation.
* The inclusion of an executive summary was helpful in delivering the work as a whole but it would have been further strengthened by the inclusion of the overarching recommendations within this summary.
* Additional formatting could have helped deliver key points. In regards to the executive summary this did not really deliver a clear overview of the report as a whole.
* _An executive summary should encapsulate all of the key points and be capable of being read by a senior manager in isolation._
* The report was an excellent summary of a complex subject. It was presented with a real clarity which met the brief for developing a business focused report.
