% This section should assess your results/findings and your analyses of these.
% Examples of techniques you may use include reasoned evaluation, thorough product testing, scientific testing, data analysis, internal and external validation and statistical survey.
% You would normally make use of more than one technique, and your use of the techniques should reflect the postgraduate nature of the research.
% You should also justify your choice of techniques.
% This section also assesses your discussion on how your findings contribute to the wider academic body of knowledge, and any comparison of your results/findings/hypotheses with those of others.

Assessing the results collected and findings from the work done in the previous chapter, the reasoned evaluation and data analysis will be discussed here, that will be closed off with the validation of the data. \par
Analysing the data is the most logical continuing from the results gathered as the main aim was on conclusions of behavioural analysis. Discussions on the contribution to the wider body of knowledge will also form a part of this section. \par

Primarily, the techniques for addressing the results is presented next. \par

\startsection[title=Techniques]
Two techniques will be used to address the results in this chapter. Firstly, the analytical approach that is presented with the data and the analysis of the data. The second technique will be a reasoned evaluation of the findings itself. \par
In relation to the data being used for analysis, the database with the collected geodata from the sensors of the system for the particular routes in the experiment via the \infull{ADS-B} can be seen in the \in{Chart}{.}[table:ads]. \par
With the statistical data analysis, also the main subject of this paper, a comparison has been presented by using the same data-set to feed into the old machine learning technique described in \in{Section}[section:existingmodels] as well as the behavioural model this paper explained in detail (see \in{Section}[section:model]). Further comparisons have been shown between the different applications of the Bayesian estimation techniques (see \in{Appendix}[section:charts]). \par
The main outcome of these comparisons is to take the machine learning average of known-good routes as a baseline and compare the improvements of the behavioural analysis against that. Also the Bayesian techniques itself are compared with each other, taken the mean function with the estimation filters as a baseline to compare against and see whether the threshold of 5\% deviation can be achieved, thus improving the detection time of the anomalies as well as the precision in terms of the percentage representing the threshold being reached. \par
It has been shown that the comparison between the signature based methods and the estimation filters indeed validating the assumption of major improvements in anomaly detection (see \in{Section}[section:resultscomparison]). \par
Reasoned evaluation on how the findings support the idea of a proactive approach with future state prediction is at hand. How the pattern based threat detection is more viable than signatures in itself is also getting addressed here. \par
The improvements have been tied to metrics that can be compared with in terms of time and precision and therefore presenting a scientific evidence. \par

\startsection[title={Comparison of the Results},reference=section:resultscomparison]
Comparing the results from the data in the experiments taken, it can be deduced that indeed the threshold of anomalies can be narrowed down to a 5\% margin for deviations from the baseline. \par

This chapter has summed up the results that were collected and analysed the data from the findings in order to show the contribution this paper has had for the domain of cyber security as a whole. \par
The project evaluation in form of a discussion is following up next. \par
