% This section should assess your results/findings and your analyses of these.
% Examples of techniques you may use include reasoned evaluation, thorough product testing, scientific testing, data analysis, internal and external validation and statistical survey.
% You would normally make use of more than one technique, and your use of the techniques should reflect the postgraduate nature of the research.
% You should also justify your choice of techniques.
% This section also assesses your discussion on how your findings contribute to the wider academic body of knowledge, and any comparison of your results/findings/hypotheses with those of others.

This chapter looks at the results collected and analysed. \par
