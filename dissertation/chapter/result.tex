% This section should assess your results/findings and your analyses of these.
% Examples of techniques you may use include reasoned evaluation, thorough product testing, scientific testing, data analysis, internal and external validation and statistical survey.
% You would normally make use of more than one technique, and your use of the techniques should reflect the postgraduate nature of the research.
% You should also justify your choice of techniques.
% This section also assesses your discussion on how your findings contribute to the wider academic body of knowledge, and any comparison of your results/findings/hypotheses with those of others.

Assessing the results collected and findings from the work done in the previous chapter, the reasoned evaluation and data analysis will be discussed here, that will be closed off with the validation of the data. \par
Analysing the data is the most logical continuing from the results gathered as the main aim was on conclusions of behavioural analysis. Discussions on the contribution to the wider body of knowledge will also form a part of this section. \par
