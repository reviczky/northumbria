% Motivation for the Project
With the upcoming disruptive technologies around autonomous driving of cyber-physical systems the increase of cyber threats against such systems has not yet been matched with appropriate security design and is lacking approaches to incorporate proactive preventative measures. \par
% Research Hypothesis / Question / Aim
Thus, the aim of this project was to present a novel method of analysing comparable travel routes in real-time to predict anomalies through a use-case of hijacked connected cars. \par
% Work Done
To prove the advancement and benefits with this new approach of predictive modelling in comparison to existing industry-standard signature based machine learning models, multiple simulations have been conducted by incorporating different Bayesian estimation techniques to analyse and predict future states based on previous behaviour in order to show a vastly increased time-window for reaction when encountering anomalies. \par
% Key Results
This research paper showed and concluded that detecting real-time deviations for malicious intent with predictive and behavioural methods are far superior in precision and effectiveness than the retrospective comparison of known-good behaviour and therefore, a significantly quicker reaction can be undertaken to counter cyber-attacks. \par
% Conclusions
By creating profiling based behavioural algorithms to detect anomalies with the use-case of hijacked connected cars the project achieved to demonstrate how to deal with cyber threats by design as early as they happen in the kill chain. \par
% Further Work
Taking these findings into further research, the creation of a proactive warning mechanism and a reactive engagement or interception of command and control could be developed. \par
