% The conclusions should present the answer to the original research question, along with any other conclusions reached along the way (for example, about the best choice of tools or technologies).
% There should be no 'surprises' in this chapter: each conclusion should have been noted and evidenced elsewhere in the dissertation.
% Recommendations should also be included for further research, for any possible practical applications, or any recommendations for future practice.

This final chapter will look at. \par

This final chapter has looked at the project's conclusion by answering the research question posed at the beginning of the paper on proactive cyber threat detection of \infull{CPS} using Bayesian estimation.
Through the case study on connected cars it has been shown that a novel way of dealing with anomalies can be introduced and that cyber defence is achievable. \par
Suggestions have been made for continuing the work based on the findings presented in this paper and a clear path of taking this research further has been shown. \par
With this, the formal part of the thesis is closed. \hfill \blacksquare \par
