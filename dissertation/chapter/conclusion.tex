% The conclusions should present the answer to the original research question, along with any other conclusions reached along the way (for example, about the best choice of tools or technologies).
% There should be no 'surprises' in this chapter: each conclusion should have been noted and evidenced elsewhere in the dissertation.
% Recommendations should also be included for further research, for any possible practical applications, or any recommendations for future practice.

Concluding on the work that was done through the proposed research question set out at the start of the project all the way along the construction of this paper, each of the following sections will arrive to the conclusions in reference to the project. \par
Starting off by recapping the problem statement and reviewing the outlined objectives of the project the content of this section will move on to summarise the reflection of the conducted work before mapping out the results that have been found. \par
The chapter will finally look at the further research options and also propose practical implementations on threat prediction as well as suggesting ways of application for warning and tracking systems. \par

Thus, the conclusions for this paper using Bayesian estimation and tracking for threat prevention in connected cars \cite[authoryear][haug2012bayesian] are as follows. \par

\startsection[title=Addressing the Problem Statement]
Before setting out and addressing the problem of cyber threat detection the landscape of current solutions within the field of connected devices had been looked at. Whilst semi-autonomous vehicles do address partially the challenges of cyber-attacks it was presented that the way they are implementing defences are exclusively signature based machine learning algorithms. Clearly there is a lack of cyber resilience in current connected vehicles. \par
Therefore, in order to address the problem of proactive anomaly detection it has been shown that by replacing machine learning with behavioural analysis can achieve built-in security for \infull{CPS} and for that the use case of fully autonomous connected cars have been taken as a subject of a series of experiments. \par
With the specific scenario of cyber hijacking and change of routes the threat modelling of remote hacking and cyber espionage was highlighted as potential dangerous intrusion events and it has been presented that behaviour analysis and profiling can be the answer to solve this deficiency. \par
To achieve a complete proactive approach on built-in security suggestions have been made on the on-the-fly reaction models that tackle the incidents uncovered with anomaly detection. \par
Proving that real-time threat detection is a problem that can be successfully addressed this paper demonstrated the theory on a sub-set of \infull{CPS} by observing connected cars and their autonomous behaviour with the help of sensor data that included geolocation, speed and cardinal direction. \par
In conclusion, the current methods of machine learning found in contemporary vehicles are unpractical when it comes to cyber-attacks and detecting anomalies. Substituting that with profiling based behavioural analysis tackles the problem statement in a way it should have been addressed in the first place. \par

% Recommendations should also be included for further research, for any possible practical applications, or any recommendations for future practice.

Now that the problem statement has been addressed, the objectives that have been set out met and through the elaboration of the work that this paper documented the conclusion be drawn that the results prove the hypothesis, the attention is shifting now towards the opportunities these results will unleash and enable to be used for other projects. \par
Since the research question on using Bayesian estimation for threat detection has been demonstrated, further work can be done on looking at optimising data collection with sensor values that is available to detect anomalies. Physical system specific solutions could enhance resilience for targeted transportation vehicles. \par
Recommendations on utilising the findings in this project is not limited but shown and included in the list below: \par
\startitemize[joinedup,nowhite]
\sym{»} The development of decision and reaction making algorithms, including \infull{AI} (AI) in order to instruct the system on how to counter-attack the cyber threat
\sym{»} Defining fail-save stopping, safe disconnection and shutdown when breached; this could also include scenarios of attacking the national grid or the internet
\sym{»} A practical application of a global tracking and warning system (similar to the ones used in the aviation industry) would enhance the security and traffic management
\sym{»} Incorporating these techniques into a centralised control centre for cyber-attacks (including ITS) would enable the analysis to be conducted on a holistic level
\stopitemize
With the methods of detecting anomalies in data flows in fully autonomous connected cars, future practice could be applicable for land, sea and air-based transportation systems to be automated by addressing cyber security aspects. \par
Another angle of research could be also to look at human behavioural patterns versus fully level 5 autonomous system behaviour, as human behaviour tends to be more creative and unpredictable in contrast to programmed system procedures. \par
On legal and legislative topics there are many open questions around personal data, data privacy and data protection as well as ethical implications on the automated decision making which could be addressed. \par

This final chapter has looked at the project's conclusion by answering the research question posed at the beginning of the paper on proactive cyber threat detection of \infull{CPS} using Bayesian estimation.
Through the case study on connected cars it has been shown that a novel way of dealing with anomalies can be introduced and that cyber defence is achievable. \par
Suggestions have been made for continuing the work based on the findings presented in this paper and a clear path of taking this research further has been shown. \par
With this, the formal part of the thesis is closed. \hfill \blacksquare \par
