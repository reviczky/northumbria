\startchapter[title={Critical Review of the Literature},reference=chapter:literature]
% https://patthomson.net/2014/01/16/connecting-chapterschapter-introductions/

The literature review in this chapter is looking at the relevant contemporary papers, books and articles related to the project and gives definitions as well as a frame to the subject of behavioural analysis and why the research question is justified. \par
Building a logical flow, the sections will cover the validity of the case study of connected cars followed by the review of existing models on data analysis and solutions utilised in the field. Continuing with the elaboration on the data capturing techniques for \infull{CPS} and different takes on system profiling models that will make up behavioural data with references to state-of-the-art research will lead to answering questions on how to deal with anomaly detection. In order to relate to current cyber threats and giving evidence of the contribution this project provides, the closing critique will be on the topic of threat prediction methods. \par

% Relevancy to the paper, work done, results found, strenghts of findings and critical evaluation
Each section explains the relevancy to this paper, discussing the work that has been done containing the results found and the stengths of these findings. All of the literature presented will be critically evaluated and linked back to the project. \par

\startsection[title=Usability Study]
% Relevancy
As the paper is proving the research question on a case study of connected cars, this section will dive into the importance of the subset of \infull{CPS} and what autonomous and semi-autonomous control stands for, how far remote control can be taken. Through the comparison of literature on estimation techniques and signature based learning the gathered intelligence is linked to the new threat landscape of cyber-attacks. \par
% Work done & Results found
Even though this research is touching the whole space of \infull{CPS}, systems that {\it\quote{interface directly with the physical world, making the detection of environmental changes and the system behavior adaptation to be considered the key challenge}} \cite[authoryear][krishna2014challenges], the hypothesis of proactive approach is proven on a specific sub-set of vehicles, namely connected cars. \par
As connected cars will be the building blocks of the emerging \infull{IoV} (IoV) \cite[authoryear][6823640] it is a perfect example to conduct the experiments on for behaviour profiling. \par
The different levels of automation between manually driven, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous connected vehicles, that can navigate themselves without any human interaction or input is described and explained in the book of \quote{Preparing a Nation for Autonomous Vehicles} \cite[authoryear][Fagnant2015167]. For this case study the baseline will be set on level 5, fully autonomous connected cars. \par
Communication channels and flow of communication between \infull{CPS} is shown in \in{Figure}[figure:cps]. Looking at the importance of profiling autonomous vehicles with deduced behaviour like vehicle usage, see \in{Figure}[figure:vehicleuse], the comparable profiles build the base of correlating behavioural analysis, so that norming against general behaviour will give the mean against which the deviation will be calculated. \par
In order to put the entire simulation into perspective of tackling a proactive approach on detecting anomalies, these behaviours will be analysed with the different sequential Bayesian estimation techniques as seen in \in{Section}[section:anomalydetection]. \par
Having had the specific set of vehicles defined for this project, the type of profiling and behaviour on navigation explained, the very last aspect on why all this is relevant is the real problem of cyber threats that these autonomous vehicles will be exposed and are facing from the internet \cite[authoryear][6803166]. This brings a whole new set of challenging situations \cite[authoryear][adouane2016autonomous], like the particular one on cyber-hijacking, that has to be dealt with. \par

By choosing \infull{CPS} as the subject of systems to analyse, the entirety of data analysis on the vehicles will create the foundation of a security baseline to protect proactively from external or internal attacks. \par

\startsection[title=Existing Models on Data Analysis]
% Relevancy
This section is looking at the existing models that are available and used in the industry that can help to analyse the motion patterns of connected cars. Most of the work has been done on network traffic log analysis and this will be looked at for adoption for interpreting sensor readings. \par
There are several different data analysis methods \cite[authoryear][miles2013qualitative]. Pattern matching tries to find common structure to compare and group against. Sequential and qualitative analysis utilises ordering and takes an analytical approach on the data, whereas sampling will focus on bounding the collection of data. \par
Most of the historical work was conducted on \infull{IDPS} and the analysis on network log traffic \cite[authoryear][Krugel:2002:SSA:508791.508835]. Although it is certainly a knowledge-base to be build from, the fast changing constellation of connected systems needs to adapt a new approach on dynamic analysis. \par
One of the more recently adopted techniques compromising behavioural data analysis is based on recursive Bayesian estimation \cite[authoryear][Bergman99recursivebayesian], arguing that signature based machine learning of known-good/known-bad states takes too much time to establish a baseline and is prone to multiple false-positive findings. Machine learning tends to be less able to react to real events at an adequate time-frame \cite[authoryear][alpaydin2014introduction] and makes it difficult to react proactively, especially on novel environmental set-ups. \par
By looking specifically on how profiling and behavioural analysis has been analysed on different types of traffic accident scenarios \cite[authoryear][Parker1995571], a good profiling pattern can be derived on the data being processed. \par
% Work done
This paper stresses the significant difference between Bayesian estimation techniques of behavioural analysis and commonly used signature based machine learning solutions in current semi-autonomous cars. \par
% Results found
The results underline that approaching data analysis with predictive behavioural profiling on estimated future states is the better approach for \infull{CPS}. \par
