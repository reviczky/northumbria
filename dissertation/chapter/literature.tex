\startchapter[title={Critical Review of the Literature},reference=chapter:literature]
% https://patthomson.net/2014/01/16/connecting-chapterschapter-introductions/

The literature review in this chapter is looking at the relevant contemporary papers, books and articles related to the project and gives definitions as well as a frame to the subject of behavioural analysis and why the research question is justified. \par
Building a logical flow, the sections will cover the validity of the case study of connected cars followed by the review of existing models on data analysis and solutions utilised in the field. Continuing with the elaboration on the data capturing techniques for \infull{CPS} and different takes on system profiling models that will make up behavioural data with references to state-of-the-art research will lead to answering questions on how to deal with anomaly detection. In order to relate to current cyber threats and giving evidence of the contribution this project provides, the closing critique will be on the topic of threat prediction methods. \par

% Relevancy to the paper, work done, results found, strenghts of findings and critical evaluation
Each section explains the relevancy to this paper, discussing the work that has been done containing the results found and the stengths of these findings. All of the literature presented will be critically evaluated and linked back to the project. \par

\startsection[title=Usability Study]
% Relevancy
As the paper is proving the research question on a case study of connected cars, this section will dive into the importance of the subset of \infull{CPS} and what autonomous and semi-autonomous control stands for, how far remote control can be taken. Through the comparison of literature on estimation techniques and signature based learning the gathered intelligence is linked to the new threat landscape of cyber-attacks. \par
% Work done & Results found
Even though this research is touching the whole space of \infull{CPS}, systems that {\it\quote{interface directly with the physical world, making the detection of environmental changes and the system behavior adaptation to be considered the key challenge}} \cite[authoryear][krishna2014challenges], the hypothesis of proactive approach is proven on a specific sub-set of vehicles, namely connected cars. \par
As connected cars will be the building blocks of the emerging \infull{IoV} (IoV) \cite[authoryear][6823640] it is a perfect example to conduct the experiments on for behaviour profiling. \par
The different levels of automation between manually driven, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous connected vehicles, that can navigate themselves without any human interaction or input is described and explained in the book of \quote{Preparing a Nation for Autonomous Vehicles} \cite[authoryear][Fagnant2015167]. For this case study the baseline will be set on level 5, fully autonomous connected cars. \par
Communication channels and flow of communication between \infull{CPS} is shown in \in{Figure}[figure:cps]. Looking at the importance of profiling autonomous vehicles with deduced behaviour like vehicle usage, see \in{Figure}[figure:vehicleuse], the comparable profiles build the base of correlating behavioural analysis, so that norming against general behaviour will give the mean against which the deviation will be calculated. \par
In order to put the entire simulation into perspective of tackling a proactive approach on detecting anomalies, these behaviours will be analysed with the different sequential Bayesian estimation techniques as seen in \in{Section}[section:anomalydetection]. \par
Having had the specific set of vehicles defined for this project, the type of profiling and behaviour on navigation explained, the very last aspect on why all this is relevant is the real problem of cyber threats that these autonomous vehicles will be exposed and are facing from the internet \cite[authoryear][6803166]. This brings a whole new set of challenging situations \cite[authoryear][adouane2016autonomous], like the particular one on cyber-hijacking, that has to be dealt with. \par

By choosing \infull{CPS} as the subject of systems to analyse, the entirety of data analysis on the vehicles will create the foundation of a security baseline to protect proactively from external or internal attacks. \par

\startsection[title=Existing Models on Data Analysis]
% Relevancy
This section is looking at the existing models that are available and used in the industry that can help to analyse the motion patterns of connected cars. Most of the work has been done on network traffic log analysis and this will be looked at for adoption for interpreting sensor readings. \par
There are several different data analysis methods \cite[authoryear][miles2013qualitative]. Pattern matching tries to find common structure to compare and group against. Sequential and qualitative analysis utilises ordering and takes an analytical approach on the data, whereas sampling will focus on bounding the collection of data. \par
Most of the historical work was conducted on \infull{IDPS} and the analysis on network log traffic \cite[authoryear][Krugel:2002:SSA:508791.508835]. Although it is certainly a knowledge-base to be build from, the fast changing constellation of connected systems needs to adapt a new approach on dynamic analysis. \par
One of the more recently adopted techniques compromising behavioural data analysis is based on recursive Bayesian estimation \cite[authoryear][Bergman99recursivebayesian], arguing that signature based machine learning of known-good/known-bad states takes too much time to establish a baseline and is prone to multiple false-positive findings. Machine learning tends to be less able to react to real events at an adequate time-frame \cite[authoryear][alpaydin2014introduction] and makes it difficult to react proactively, especially on novel environmental set-ups. \par
By looking specifically on how profiling and behavioural analysis has been analysed on different types of traffic accident scenarios \cite[authoryear][Parker1995571], a good profiling pattern can be derived on the data being processed. \par
% Work done
This paper stresses the significant difference between Bayesian estimation techniques of behavioural analysis and commonly used signature based machine learning solutions in current semi-autonomous cars. \par
% Results found
The results underline that approaching data analysis with predictive behavioural profiling on estimated future states is the better approach for \infull{CPS}. \par

\startsection[title=Data Capturing for Connected Things]
% Relevancy
Without valid and quality data that will be captured through the various sensors of the connected car, the analysis would be meaningless. Therefore, it is utmost important to define what data needs to be captured, through what means (readings of sensor data) and that the quality of reading is ensured, coupled with minimal misreadings and errors. Some of the inevitably present abnormal readings left in the data-set can be filtered out with mathematical models. \par
For the definition of the data-set and capturing techniques, this paper is looking at established methods already in used within the aviation industry. The global tracking system \infull{ADS-B} (ADS-B) defines prerequisite data types that needs to be sent through radar capturing facilities \cite[authoryear][McCallie201178]. Among the required fields are flight ID, geolocation, time, speed and various other sensor readings. For an illustration of the raw \infull{CSV} (CSV) data, see table \in{Table}[table:ads] in the Appendix. The following screenshot of a live ADS-B tracking along an airport gives an indication how this is going to be used in relation to connected cars for this project: \par

More importantly, there is already some form of data capturing available with electric car-sharing providers, the so-called Car-Sharing Modules (CSM) \cite[authoryear][lee2011electric]. Although proprietary, the captured data includes the user renting the car, readings of battery charge, location and speed and log data from the machine learning application. \par
On a more higher level, this paper also ponders the viability of \infull{ITS} (ITS), with data from connected vehicles going to a command-and-control centre for intelligent traffic distribution and threat prevention \cite[authoryear][6526427]. \par
% Work done
This paper has proposed and developed a data format for recording vital sensor readings of connected cars, based on the ADS-B model. This open data is suggested as an industry standard for all car manufacturers. \par
% Results found
Having a global standard to compare data and run data analysis on helped creating comparable data sets to show differences in approaches on data analysis. \par

\startsection[title=Behavioural Profiling]
% Relevancy
Profiling is the first stage of analysing and concatenating similar groups of behaviour together. Behaviour of like-minded people are similar and drivers in similar roles behave in almost identical patterns. Bus drivers for example have very similar reactions to speed, route and alertness. \par
Different types of individuals but also systems behave differently but deducing and predicting a collection of a group with similar correlation can lead to a conclusion on whether an expected behaviour is unusual. \par
Creating profiles to detect patterns usually assigned to intruders breaking into the system \cite[authoryear][lunt1993detecting] can help determine likelihoods of deviation and raise suspicion on anomalies. Looking specifically at these patterns for a system based profiling as compared to human behaviour profiling of \infull{CPS} is adding value in combination of the estimation techniques discussed in the previous section. \par
Network traffic behaviour has been researched and different profiling data groups have been established \cite[authoryear][4455451], which will be taken advantage of to create parallel profiling templates for connected cars. \par
% Work done
There has been done some research on human behaviour profiling, with different types of groups behaving in a similar pattern (commuting people, families and various other types like taxi drivers). \par
In this paper the focus shifted towards whether a profile pattern can be established with autonomous systems in order to combine these groups with the machine learning estimation techniques. \par
% Results found
It has been shown that indeed it is even more easier to group pre-defined system behaviour on predicted routes as compared to humans driving freely on the motorway. Through profiling it is now also possible to distinguish between autonomous and non-autonomous driven vehicles. \par
