\startchapter[title=Introduction]
The world is getting more and more connected with each other through wireless communications and new semi and indeed fully autonomous cyber-physical systems taking over and shaping the traffic of the public space from automotive transportation through aerial vehicles of drones and aircraft systems. \par
The rationale for this paper was motivated by the challenges of increasing cyber threats posed by and to such systems \cite[authoryear][loukas2015cyber], specifically, the gap of resilience in addressing its security design and the lack of real-time cyber threat detection of malicious intruders. \par

are playing a bigger role than ever \par
The proposal
the "Internet of Things" is looking at a novel way of predicting cyber threats of a specific sub-set of said cyber-physical systems \cite[authoryear][citeulike:13779694], by applying a specialised version of the Bayesian estimation to compare the predicted behaviour of cyber-physical systems with the actual motion patterns \cite[authoryear][Fox03bayesianfiltering]. Taking advantage of known-good behaviour of large-scale movement flows at a regulated traffic \cite[authoryear][perallos2015intelligent], it can be deducted when a system behaves in a rogue manner. \par

\startsection[title=Problem Statement]
In this section, set out the main aim(s) of your project and explain what they mean. The aim is the fundamental purpose of what you were trying to do – to find out something, to make something, to test something. There is usually only one or two aims and they are often expressed in terms of a hypothesis or research question. \par

\startsection[title=Aim]
% In this section, set out the main aim(s) of your project and explain what they mean.

There is usually only one or two aims and they are often expressed in terms of a hypothesis or research question. \par
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the pro-active approach of predicting cyber security threats in connected cars, as an example of a cyber-physical system, through deviations in behaviour profiling patterns on location awareness using mathematical probability density functions. \par

By detecting deviations from predicted desired future state spectrum the project will achieve to create a warning mechanism for cyber threats on cyber-physical systems and being able to react in a fail-safe manner. \par

\startsection[title=Objectives]
%In this section, explain the objectives of your project. These are the sub-goals you needed to achieve in order to complete your project. There will be several objectives – typically around eight. \par
%An objective should be a definite statement that can be clearly identified as "complete" or "not complete". A statement like "To improve my understanding of programming" is too vague, as it is not clear whether it is complete or not. A statement like "To learn how to use dynamic memory structures in C++" is clearer. \par
%You may also wish to include objectives that discuss the parts of your dissertation, like "To produce a literature survey on the subject of…" or "To write a discussion of the implementation of the system". \par
%It is fine to include objectives that you did not complete. Explain why you did not achieve them. Also make clear any new objectives that you have added since writing your research proposal. \par

In order to achieve the aims and validate the hypothesis the following steps have to be completed:

\startitemize[joinedup,nowhite]
\item Define the criteria of vehicles to be counting as a cyber-physical systems in the study (connected cars)
\item Create a set of data and format on behaviour profiling that will be needed for the analysis and estimation: \color[black]{\it speed, location, time, weight}
\item Compare and contrast different density functions, particularly Bayesian estimation algorithms
\item Combine the estimation techniques to create a formula and algorithm to predict future positions
\item Validate the predicted values on historical data (sensors, simulations)
\item Propose a live warning alarm system (similar to the ground proximity alarm in planes) and a live tracking site (see flightradar24.com)
\item Suggest fail-safe actions to be implemented in autonomous systems (disconnect and safely stop)
\stopitemize

Given these steps, there should be possible to show the holistic approach of anomaly detection in connected cars. \par
