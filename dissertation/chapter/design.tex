% This should discuss any practical work done.
% If a significant software product is built then this should include a discussion of each stage of the software development life cycle, including:
% Definition of requirements; Design; Implementation; Testing
% Along with consideration of any tools and technologies used (languages, IDEs, third-party components used, etc).
% Similarly if your practical work has consisted of experimental work, then this should include a discussion of each stage of the experimental process including
% Definition of experimental variables and other requirements; Design of experiments; Implementation; Collection of Results
% Along with consideration of any tools and technologies used.
% This discussion should outline the choices made, along with any alternatives considered and the reasons for those choices.

% This section should assess the discussion of the practical work you have done, such as requirements analysis, software design, construction, installation, experimental work.
% Your testing and/or data collection approach should be included in this section although the results from this form part of the next section.
% You should make it clear what you have done, but you should also include rationales for the approaches and techniques used, as well as a discussion of any ideas that have been rejected.

This chapter is looking at the design of the project. \par
