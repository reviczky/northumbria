I would like to express my sincere gratitude for those who have helped me during the course of preparation and along the way to conduct my research up until completion of my master thesis. \par

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Haider al-Khateeb for all his efforts, valuable feedback and guidance throughout the whole project. \par
His critical review of my work and experience in the field helped me to achieve finding the right topic and keeping to the standards I was aiming for. \par
During the work of my project I was able to improve and broaden my understanding of cyber-physical systems and gain knowledge on the cyber security topic in much greater detail. \par

Furthermore, I am extremely lucky to have had been taught by Gregory Epiphaniou during the entirety of the course and I would like to thank him for his advice and encouraging words and all the time he made available for discussing the ideas for my topic and the vast amount of suggestions of relevant research papers. \par

To my fellow students at the February 2015 cohort my greatest appreciation, particularly to Rafael Narezzi and Stefan Fernandes with whom I have bounced ideas and thoughts and also for all the discussions we have had around cyber security which has helped me shaping my dissertation to embrace contemporary views. \par

Lastly, I am humbled to be given the opportunity to study and take this masters course in cyber security, that was made possible through QA by Northumbria University. \par

My thesis would not be complete with the help of my friends and family for proofreading and editing and therefore, I would like to give my gratitudes to my friend Clare Canton who taught me at the English Language Centre at King's College London %, Ekaterina Gerasimova
and my sister √Ågnes Reviczky-Balogh. \par
